However, in the end, it worked out. We pulled off not one, but two events in the span of a year, at two different locations and even managed to partner with our city in the process.

Logistics is a headache, but it isn’t something that a simple google search, a quick readthrough of MLH’s Hackathon Organizing Guide or a quick chat with another organizer from another city or another school won’t fix.

Without them, you don’t have money to buy food, prizes, rent a venue or provide your hackers with frankly anything. Not all sponsors will be able to provide money, rather opting to provide access to their APIs, sending engineers or mentors over or running a workshop. This is especially true if you are a first time event or a very small event. In this scenario, you may not have alot to offer sponsors, and they may not see value in providing you with money. Their value to you, to an extent, outweighs your value to them. That’s okay, considering that things like API credits, swag, free domain names for your hackers, engineers to teach workshops and mentors are all very important in making your event a success. For example, at Hack the Hammer, while we were unable to get Google to provide us with monetary sponsorship, they did send over engineers to teach a workshop, distribute swag and mentor participants. This, greatly improved hacker experience and made our event better overall.","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":1,"offset":2978},"end":{"line":18,"column":1050,"offset":4027},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":1,"offset":2978},"end":{"line":18,"column":1050,"offset":4027},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Ironically, some of our largest sponsors were the least involved in our event.

Since sponsorship dollars may be limited, it’s important to think up activities that cost very little or no money. At Hack the Hammer, some of these included Cup Stacking (a hackathon favourite), Red Bull Pong and a twist on !Light (a game where people tried to replicate a webpage using their HTML and CSS skills without access to any online resources, while trying to consume a bowl of spicy ramen).","position":{"start":{"line":24,"column":1,"offset":4516},"end":{"line":24,"column":863,"offset":5378},"indent":[]}}],"position":{"start":{"line":24,"column":1,"offset":4516},"end":{"line":24,"column":863,"offset":5378},"indent":[]}},{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Hacker experience is very important, because at the end of the day it doesn’t matter how much money you raise but how your hackers felt at the event.

Hackathons can be very stressful environments, especially in the morning before demos, where many teams are rushing to complete their projects and many more are trying to get theirs to work.
