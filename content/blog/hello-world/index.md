In the spirit of Canada Day (I'm obnoxiously late) and to get my to-do list app off my back, I finally decided to sit down for an evening and build a simple little personal website / blog, something I've been meaning to do for the past month.

I built it using Gatsby, in the hopes of trying to get a better understanding of React (a tool I've had a love-hate relationship with for the past year), and to make myself record the stuff I'll be _hopefully_ working on over the summer break. 

I'll be filling this blog with whatever I want to fill it with, but I'll try to keep it programming-related, from reflections on work to new technical concepts I've learned, to help me _and hopefully others_, work through problems they encounter.
